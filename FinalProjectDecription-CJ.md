GOAL OF THE PROJECT: The aim of the Computation Jockey project has been to show the efficacy of using DJ control interfaces in order to manipulate-in-real-time Mathematica visualizations as a method and aid for educational exposition or outreach.

SUMMARY OF WORK: We have connected an AKAI Professional APC40 MIDI controller to manipulate dynamical visualizations of Julia set fractals and elementary cellular automata. In order to do this we had to use Hairless MIDI-to-serial bridge software along with the Virtual Serial Port Driver from ELTIMA software. We also have the VGA output from the computer converting to analog video in order to use video processing including: Kaoss Pad Entrancer video jockey (vj) controller, a Roland V-4 video mixer (which can "feedback on itself), and a Dave Jones MVIP color processor powered through a Doepfer Eurorack A-100 power system. 

RESULTS AND FUTURE  WORK: The results of this work have been positive in that we have been able to connect a control console, AKAI Professional's APC40 MIDI controller, to control Mathematica visualizations of both Julia set fractals and elementary cellular automata in realtime. We have been able to map buttons to load different "systems" of visualizations (ie. Julia sets or cellular automata) and sliders in order to control specific parameters within these systems. In the future I will try to interface multiple midi controllers at once as well as turntable controllers to the system, as well as further develop the kinds of dynamical systems it can interface with. I also plan to create a system GUI for the CJ architecture interface. I will work on spreading this concept and paradigm in education, academia, and STEM outreach.
